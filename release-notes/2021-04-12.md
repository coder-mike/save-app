If you "add to home screen", the web app renders in full screen much like a native app.

## Synchronization between devices (event-sourced model)

The app behaves much better now when using multiple devices at the same time. Individual actions (e.g. changing the name or price of an item) are actively synchronized between devices on the same account so you don't lose any changes.

## Known Issues

The event-sourcing has broken the "undo" feature, since the live synchronization just pulls the undone actions back from the server as if they'd been initiated from another device.
